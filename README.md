# Colorectal-TWAS-in-East-Asians

Specific Aim: To search for colorectal cancer (CRC) susceptibility genes, we performed a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) in East-Asians. 

Main data resources:

1. GWAS sumamry statistics data from ACCC including 23,572 cases and 48,700 controls of East Asians

2. We genotyped DNA samples from 364 CRC East-Asian patients and conducted RNA-sequencing in their tumor-adjacent normal colon tissues to build genetic models to predict gene expression. 

3. Published TWAS findings among 125,478 Subjects in European populations (PMID: 33058866)
